# plugin.video.lostfilm.tv
LostFilm.tv addon for Kodi.tv (Fork)

I'll try to add usful features to this fork of plugin.

So far there is:

* All tv shows
* My Favorites 
* Newest Tv Shows
* New episodes of my favorites (10 so far - will increase in few days )
* Top 100 best finished tv shows 

**Things that mostly will not be implemented:**
* Series plot (this requires many additional http requests and it's not optimal).
* Kodi library integration (i see no reason for this)


If you found bug submit them to [Issues](https://github.com/Tommixoft/plugin.video.lostfilm.tv/issues)

To use this plugin - you must have account in [lostfilm.tv](http://lostfilm.tv). Plugin gets all data from website, including favorites and what episodes you already seen. There is no local library, or cache.

##Installation##
